Workflow

* PbTe-res-on-grid.ipynb: compute resolution functions on a grid and fit using EEAffineModel and interpolate
* convolution.ipynb: convolve dispersion with interpolated resolution function

Other notebooks
* PbTe-explore-one-point-use-dgsres.singlextal.fit2ee.ipynb:  explore resolution fitting at one point. fit to EEAffineModel
* PbTe-res-on-grid-use_icg.ipynb: same as PbTe-res-on-grid.ipynb, but fit to Ikeda Carpenter function
